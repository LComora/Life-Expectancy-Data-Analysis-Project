## Life Expectancy Data Analysis Project
### 📊 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. It focuses on cleaning and analyzing data related to global life expectancy, aiming to uncover insights about factors that affect life expectancy in various countries over time.

>The analysis involved data wrangling techniques using Python and pandas, and it culminated in an exploratory data analysis to highlight trends and anomalies.

### 🔧 Technologies Used
* Python

* Pandas

* Numpy

* Matplotlib

* Seaborn

* Jupyter Notebook

### 🧹 Data Wrangling
The dataset underwent the full wrangling process:

Gathering: Extracted from a CSV source and supplemental files.

Assessing: Identified missing, inaccurate, or inconsistent data.

Cleaning: Applied various transformations to prepare the data for analysis.

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA addressed questions like:

>How has life expectancy changed over the years globally?

>Which factors correlate most with higher or lower life expectancy?

>How do different countries and regions compare?
